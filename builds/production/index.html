My strengths include but are not limited to (1) A strong foundation in classic & contemporary graphic & web design; (2) Finding inventive solutions to a client’s marketing design strategy. Drawing from my nerdy interests in pop culture e.g. graphic novels, books, movies & music I am not afraid to present more playful designs should a client wish to explore such. (3) The ability to communicate effectively with management, clients & the public at all levels; (4) Being originally from South Africa, a strong sense of gender & cultural sensitivity; (5) An insatiable thirst to learn everything I possibly can & apply it where needed; (6) A great sense of humor.</p></header><h1>Expertise</h1><div class=image-block><img class=img-responsive src=images/branding.png> <img class=img-responsive src=images/print.png> <img class=img-responsive src=images/web.png></div><h1>Experience</h1><div class=exIcon><img src=images/fb.svg width=20px></div><div class=exParagraph><p><span class=eHeader>Fusebox Online</span> | <span class=pos>Web /Graphic designer</span> | 07/2014 – 02/2016 | <span class=city>Johannesburg, RSA</span><br>Took the lead in company liaison on web design for major accounts.Took projects from initial conception with clients to completion and launch.
